  # Automate Using AI and Machine Learning
  
   Automated insurance underwriting is the process where robotic process 
   automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI) software underwrites the risk of potential clients. 
   The advanced tech uses AI and machine learning (ML) to evaluate risk, decide how much coverage the client should receive, and how much they should pay for it.
